# Dynamic-Memory-Allocator

This is dynamic memory allocator that uses Best-Fit concept. I did not push testing files and script to keep things clean here 
on this repository. This is my own implementation of malloc(), calloc() and realloc() functions of stblib.h of C.

It achives utilization of 47/50 and throughput of 38/50.
